Simple-TagSearch
================

Search functions and scripts tends to be over complicated. My short and functional live TagSearch script let's you add multiple tags and styles and is only 19 lines of code.

!No nead for jQuery UI (sweeeeeeeet!)<br />
!Requires jQuery

How to use: 

Add your search box with id #searchthis
```
<input type="text" id="searchthis">
```
Paste your results anywhere on your page like this:
```
<a href="http://google.com" class="searchitem">Research by John<span>john research tanzania</span></a><br />
<a href="http://google.com" class="searchitem">Water cooperation in Tanzania<span>casper whiljt water research tanzania cooperation africa</span></a><br />
```
Put your title for the item just before the span tag of each link.
Put your search tags within the <span> tag of each link. These will not be shown, but users can search for them.

You can add as many tags that you want. Link to whatever you want and style it however you want.

I'd love to see where and if you use this! :)
